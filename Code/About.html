            <h2>About my website</h2>           
            <h3>
                Hello! My name is Alexi Michielse, I am in my first year of cmd <em>(communication and multimedia design)</em>.
                This website is the first one I ever build and as you probably quessed it's about movies. I have a passion for movies 
                and I am in the process of making one myself! But this website isn't about that, it's about 3 movies that I would recommend <em>you</em> watch.
                The 3 movies I chose don't have anything in common, they are 3 very different movies, I will now tell you a little bit about them!
            </h3>

            <h2>Borat 2</h2>
            <h3>
                Borat 2 is a comedy movie about a reporter from a foreign country who comes to deliver his daughter to Trump. I think it's main purpose is to
                get a more real side from people. For example, in the movie borat sings a racist song in front of a bucnh of people, but instead of stopping him 
                and saying it's wrong, they cheer him on and laught about it.
            </h3>

            <h2>Spider-Man: Into the spiderverse</h2>
            <h3>
                Now, I have always been a big fan of spider-man. He is by far my favorite supderhero for 1000 reasons, but I won't go into that here.
                But this movie doesn't go with Peter Parker but with Miles Morales. The movie wrote him in such a way that he is just as interesting as Peter.
                This is just a very solid movie and it is paced perfectly, if you didn't love spider-man before, you will after this movie.
            </h3>

            <h2>Shutter Island</h2>
            <h3>
                Shutter island is a movie that you will think about just before you want to go to bed. It is an amazing movie and it will have your head spinnng.
                This is in my opinion one of the best movies that has ever been made in the history of human kind, a must watch.
