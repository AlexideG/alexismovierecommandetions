            <p>		Back in 2006 "Borat: Cultural Leanings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" was, as the title character would say — "Great success!"
                Sacha Baron Cohen's big screen adaptation of the character he featured on "Da Ali G Show" back in the early 2000s was a cultural phenomenon. Cohen as Borat traveling the US to better understand its customs — and in the process tracking down Pamela Anderson to make her his wife (by trying to put her inside a "marriage sack" and abduct her) — wasn't just a box office hit but made the Borat character instantly recognizable.
                And the fact that it was done in a documentary style just increased people's fascination as everyone tried to determine who in the movie were in on the joke and who were unknowing pawns in Cohen's unique brand of comedy.
                14 years later, Borat has returned. Made with the specific purpose to come out before this year's presidential election, "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bride of American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" (or simply "Borat 2") follows Cohen's Borat as he is tasked with delivering a gift to Vice President Mike Pence, who the Kazhakstani powers-that-be believe is a sex addict.
                Like the first "Borat," he has a costar to move along the plot. His producer Azamat Bagatov (played by Ken Davitian) isn't around this time, instead, it's Borat's daughter Tutar (Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova). She gives a scene-stealing performance.
                Why you should watch: Like the first "Borat," it will be a movie you have to see to believe
                "Borat 2."
                The only way "Borat 2" can work is if the bar is higher than the first. This is a hugely daunting task, but Cohen pulls it off leading to moments that you can't believe were possible. By the time you get to the end of the movie, there are some events so shocking that even if you weren't the biggest "Borat" fan, you will be satisfied just for the simple fact that you can say you witnessed it.
                There are definitely moments in the movie where Cohen goes back to familiar material, especially the bit where the movie intercuts Borat interviewing an etiquette expert with him attempting to use them in real life (something he's done on "Da Ali G Show" and the first "Borat").
                But even the stuff that feels familiar is done so well that it will entertain the heck out of you and will certainly be "water cooler talk" for weeks to come.</p>
